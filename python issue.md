# Problem: Check how old you are on 5 May 2022

# Input: day of birthday as an integer from 1 to 31

# Input: month of birthday as an integer from 1 to 12

# Input: year of birthday as an integer from 1922 to 2010

day = 2

month = 3

year = 1998

# Calculate age based only on year

age = 2022 - year

# Adjust for month

if month > 5 :

    age = age - 1

if month == 5 and day <= 5 

    age = age - 1
    
print('On 5 May 2022 I am age ' , age , years old')
